# Raspberry Pi – Personal Server: General Guide

This repository documents the configuration and management of a server based on a Raspberry Pi 5. Here you will find how to deploy projects, automate services, use Cloudflare Tunnel, set up Docker, and follow best practices for administration.

---

## 🔧 Infrastructure
- Server: Raspberry Pi 5 8GB RAM
- Storage: 480GB SATA SSD (USB 3.0, boot + data)
- Backup: microSD card kept offline for emergency recovery
- OS: Raspberry Pi OS (Debian 12 Bookworm)

## 💾 Boot & Storage Strategy

- Raspberry Pi boots directly from a USB 3.0 SATA SSD
- SSD is used for:
  - Operating system
  - Docker images and volumes
  - Logs and long-running services
- microSD card is only used for:
  - Initial setup
  - Offline backup and emergency rollback

> ⚠️ Running Docker on SD cards is discouraged due to high I/O and wear.

## 📁 Project Organization
```
~/projects/front/angular/project-name
```
> It's recommended to separate by type: `front`, `back`, `mono`...

## 🔐 Security & Network
- SSH with key authentication and custom hostname
- Static IP: `192.168.1.41` por ejemplo (recommended via Ethernet)
- UFW enabled (allowing only port 22)

---

## 🐳 Docker: Example with Angular Project
- Multi-stage Dockerfile: build Angular + serve with Nginx
- Container name: `container-name`
- Exposes port: `8080 -> 80`

> ℹ️ Docker generates continuous disk I/O (logs, layers, volumes).  
> Using an SSD significantly improves stability and prevents SD card corruption.

### 🔁 Automatic container restart
```bash
sudo docker update --restart unless-stopped nombre-contenedor
```
Check status:
```bash
docker inspect -f '{{ .HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name }}' nombre-contenedor
```

---

## ☁️ Cloudflare Tunnel
- Tunnel created: `tunnel-name`
- Custom domain: `example-project.mydomain.xyz` # ej. my-project.developer.xyz

### 📝 Configuration
File: `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`
```yaml
tunnel: dev-tunnel
credentials-file: /home/user/.cloudflared/<UUID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: my-project.developer.xyz
    service: http://localhost:8080
  - service: http_status:404
```

### 🌐 DNS Linking
```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns nombre-tunel my-project.developer.xyz
```

### ▶️ Run tunnel manually
```bash
cloudflared tunnel run tunnel-name
```

---

## 🛠️ Tunnel Auto-Start (systemd)
File: `/etc/systemd/system/cloudflared-dev.service`
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Cloudflare Tunnel - tunnel-name
After=network.target

[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=0
Type=simple
User=username
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cloudflared tunnel run tunnel-name
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### 📌 Useful Commands
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec     # Restart systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload     # Reload services
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared-dev  # Enable on boot
sudo systemctl start cloudflared-dev   # Start service
systemctl status cloudflared-dev       # Check status
```

### 🛡️ Automatic Recovery
- Auto-restart if the tunnel fails.
- Optional advanced configuration:
```ini
StartLimitIntervalSec=30
StartLimitBurst=3
```

---

## 🔍 Useful Checks
- Verify tunnel:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel info tunnel-name
```
- List active tunnels:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel list
```
- List containers with restart policy:
```bash
docker inspect --format '{{ .Name }} => {{ .HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name }}' $(docker ps -aq)
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Scripts (manual + automated)

This repo includes reusable scripts to deploy Dockerized frontend projects (like Angular apps) to the Raspberry Pi.

### `deploy-<lowercased-repo-name>.sh`

Each project has its own deployment script located in:

```
scripts/deploy/deploy-project-name.sh
```

These scripts:
- Build Docker images using the project’s Dockerfile
- Stop and remove any existing container
- Run the new container with a restart policy
- Log clear output for manual or automated monitoring

Example:
```bash
bash scripts/deploy/deploy-coffeehaven-angular.sh
```

### `deploy-all.sh`

This meta-script scans `~/projects/` recursively and:
- Detects if each Git project has updates on the `main` branch
- If updated, runs the corresponding `deploy-<project>.sh` script
- Ignores projects without a deployment script

```bash
bash scripts/deploy-all.sh
```

> Designed to be used with cron (e.g., daily) or CI/CD hooks.

---

## 📐 Project Conventions

- All frontend projects live under: `~/projects/front/[framework]/repository-name`
- All backend projects live under: `~/projects/back/[framework]/repository-name`
- All full stack projects live under: `~/projects/mono/[framework]/repository-name`
- Each Git repo name matches the folder name

**Examples:**

| Project Type Example | Path Example                                               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Angular Frontend     | `~/projects/front/angular/CoffeeHaven-Angular`             |
| Laravel Backend      | `~/projects/back/laravel/HostControl-api`                  |
| Full Stack (Mono)    | `~/projects/mono/angular-laravel/HostControl`              |

> Folder names reflect GitHub repository names (including capital letters), but scripts, images, and containers always use lowercase names based on the repo.

---

## 🧮 Script Conventions

- Deployment scripts follow the pattern: `deploy-<lowercased-repo-name>.sh`
- Deployment scripts are located in: `scripts/deploy/`

**Examples:**

| Repo Name Example     | Script Name                    | Location                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `CoffeeHaven-Angular` | `deploy-coffeehaven-angular.sh`| `scripts/deploy/deploy-coffeehaven-angular.sh`    |
| `HostControl-api`     | `deploy-hostcontrol-api.sh`    | `scripts/deploy/deploy-hostcontrol-api.sh`        |
| `HostControl`         | `deploy-hostcontrol.sh`        | `scripts/deploy/deploy-hostcontrol.sh`            |

---

## 📦 Container and Image Conventions

Docker containers and images follow this convention:

`<project-name>-<service-name>`  # all lowercased

Examples:
- coffeehaven-frontend
- hostcontrol-backend
- hostcontrol-db

> **Note:** While folder names may reflect GitHub repository names (including capital letters), all container and image names are standardized to lowercase and follow this naming convention for consistency and automation.

---

## 🔐 Security Practices

- Secrets and environment variables are never stored in this repo.
- SSH uses public key authentication.
- UFW only allows port 22 by default.

---

## 📊 System Status

- Uptime-oriented configuration (24/7)
- Services auto-restart on failure
- Storage optimized for long-running workloads
